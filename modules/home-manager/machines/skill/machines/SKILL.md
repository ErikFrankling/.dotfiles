name: machines
description: Erik's machines, how they connect, and how much load each can take. Load before anything resource-heavy (running several agents, codex/claude sessions or jobs in parallel, batch generation, builds, test suites, local models, big downloads, anything with `&`, `xargs -P` or a worker pool), and whenever a task needs another machine (ssh, the homelab, the build server, the laptop).

# Erik's machines

| Machine | What it is | Reach it |
|---|---|---|
| **pc** | Erik's desktop: Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 16 threads, 30 GB RAM, RX 7900 XT 20 GB. LAN `192.168.50.232`. Runs Hyprland, his browsers, T3 Code (port 3773) and every agent session. | You are usually on it |
| **framework** | Erik's laptop, NixOS. Often asleep, off or away. | `ssh framework` (through the Proxmox Tailscale node; fails when asleep) |
| **proxmox** | Hypervisor, i7-6700K, 8 threads, 62 GB RAM. Runs the Tailscale subnet router for `192.168.50.0/24`. | `ssh proxmox` (root) |
| **naiaclaw** | VM 200 on proxmox: the k3s node for the homelab, 8 threads, 58 GB RAM. VIP `192.168.50.100`. | `ssh naiaclaw`, then `sudo kubectl ...` |
| **nix-builder** | A pod on naiaclaw: Nix build server and binary cache (`https://nix-cache.erikfrankling.duckdns.org`). | `ssh nix-builder`; builds with `nix build --store ssh-ng://root@192.168.50.100:2222` |

- Erik's phone and the laptop away from home reach the LAN over Tailscale.
- The homelab is configured in the homelab repo (`~/projects/personal/homelab`) and applied by Flux. The NixOS machines are configured in `~/.dotfiles`.
- Do not start VM 100 on proxmox (its address collides with the k3s VIP). Never reboot or power off any machine.

## Do not overload the pc

The pc is the machine Erik is sitting at. When it runs out of memory it does
not crash, it swaps. The desktop freezes and T3 Code stops answering. That
includes on his phone, and it includes the session you are running in. Agent
tools started from T3 Code run inside the `t3code.service` cgroup together
with the server, so your jobs and T3 Code compete for the same memory.

This has happened: on 2026-10-16 an agent started about 28 `codex exec` image
jobs at once (20 backgrounded with `&`, 8 more through `xargs -P 8`). They
took 16 GB of RAM and 13 GB of swap, and T3 Code stopped answering for 5
minutes.

Before starting anything that runs in parallel or uses a lot of memory:

1. **Estimate the cost.** One agent session (`codex exec`, `claude`) with its
   MCP servers takes roughly 0.5–1 GB. A browser, a Nix evaluation of a
   NixOS system or a big test run can each take several GB. Multiply by how
   many will run at once.
2. **Check what is free:** `free -g`, and `cat /proc/pressure/memory`
   (anything above a few percent under `full` means it is already swapping).
   Erik's browsers and apps normally use 10–15 GB on their own.
3. **Cap parallelism.** Keep the total new load to about 8 GB on the pc:
   `xargs -P 4`, a worker pool, or batches, never one `&` per item over a
   long list. Start small, watch `free -g`, then scale up if there is room.
4. **Move heavy work off the pc** when the homelab can do it: Nix builds go
   to the build server (`nix-nightly build`, or `--store ssh-ng://...`), and
   long-running services belong in the homelab. Local LLMs must fit fully in
   GPU memory (see `~/.dotfiles/AGENTS.md`).
5. **Clean up.** Do not leave background jobs, dev servers or loaded models
   running when you are done.

If the pc is already slow (`uptime` load far above 16, or high memory
pressure), do not add to it. Wait, or stop your own jobs first.
